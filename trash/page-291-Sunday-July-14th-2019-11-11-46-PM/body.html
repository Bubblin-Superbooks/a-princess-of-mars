Each was given a dagger and then, at the far end, a pack of twelve calots, or wild dogs were loosed upon them.</p><p>As the brutes, growling and foaming, rushed upon the almost defenseless women I turned my head that I might not see the horrid sight. The yells and laughter of the green horde bore witness to the excellent quality of the sport and when I turned back to the arena, as Kantos Kan told me it was over, I saw three victorious calots, snarling and growling over the bodies of their prey. The women had given a good account of themselves.</p><p>Next a mad zitidar was loosed among the remaining dogs, and so it went throughout the long, hot, horrible day.</p></div> </div>
